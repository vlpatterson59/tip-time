# Tip Time app


## What I Learned

* How to use view binding instead of ```findViewById()``` to more easily write code that interacts with views
    ```Gradle Script -> build.gradle (Module: Tip_Time.app) -> android{}```
````
    buildFeatures {
        viewBinding = true
    }
````

* How to use string parameters to  dynamically create strings

* How to use ```Logcat``` in Android Studio to find problems in an app
